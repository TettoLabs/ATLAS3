## Notes

**Strategy creation:**
1. Define high-level Steps (strategic milestones)
2. Break each Step into Substeps (tactical execution units)
3. Each Substep becomes one Effort (AI1 → AI2 → AI3 workflow)
4. Create individual step files in `steps/` directory for detailed specs

**This tracker provides overview. Step files provide detail.**

**Use ATLAS Mode 2 (Refine Strategy) to collaboratively create your Steps.**
