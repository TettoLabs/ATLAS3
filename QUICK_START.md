# ATLAS Quick Start - Operational in 2 Hours

**Purpose:** Fast track to using ATLAS3 for your company
**Time:** 2 hours to first execution
**For:** Founders who want to start immediately

---

## 2-Hour Path

### Hour 1: Understand & Configure (60 min)

**Read (30 min):**
1. README.md (5 min - what is ATLAS3)
2. ATLAS_OVERVIEW.md (15 min - skim, focus on three-phase workflow)
3. ATLAS_ENTRY_POINT.md (10 min - understand 8 Usher modes)

**Quick customize (15 min):**
```
Edit: roles/AI3_IMPLEMENTER_GUIDE.md

Add YOUR domain-specific guardrails:
- If healthcare: Add HIPAA compliance checks (line 270)
- If fintech: Add PCI DSS requirements, fraud detection
- If open source: Add API stability checks, remove security paranoia
- Your git workflow: Edit git commands to match YOUR process (line 460+)

This step is optional for 2-hour quick start but critical for real projects.
See ONBOARDING.md Phase 3 for detailed examples.
```

**Create vision doc (15 min):**
```
File: /YOUR_COMPANY_CONTEXT.md

Minimal sections (can expand later):
1. What you're building (2 paragraphs)
2. Target customer (1 paragraph)
3. Constraints (team, budget, timeline - bullet points)
4. Success metrics (6 months, 12 months - numbers)
5. Known unknowns (what you'll discover)

Total: 200-300 lines minimum

Be specific. Be honest. Don't overthink.
```

---

### Hour 2: Create Strategy & Start (60 min)

**Create Steps (30 min):**
```
Option A: Have AI create from vision:
"Read /YOUR_COMPANY_CONTEXT.md and create ATLAS strategy files

1. Create ATLAS_STEPS_TRACKER.md (overview)
2. Create steps/STEP_1.md (first milestone)
3. Create steps/STEP_2.md (second milestone)

Each step file: objective, success criteria, 2-3 substeps"

Option B: Write yourself:
- Create ATLAS_STEPS_TRACKER.md (use existing as template)
- Copy steps/STEP_TEMPLATE.md to steps/STEP_1.md
- Fill in Step 1 (detailed - 150 lines)
- Repeat for STEP_2.md (150 lines)

Total: Tracker ~200 lines + 2 step files ~300 lines = 500 lines
```

**Start executing (30 min):**
```
"Run ATLAS Mode 1" (Auto-Resume)

Usher will:
1. Scan (finds no active work)
2. Read ATLAS_STEPS_TRACKER + steps/STEP_1.md (finds STEP_1_1 PLANNED)
3. Offer: "Start AI1 research for STEP_1_1?"
4. You say yes
5. AI1 begins research (6-12 hours)

You're now executing your first substep.
```

**After 2 hours: Operational ✅**

---

## What Happens Next

**Days 1-10: First Substep**
- AI1 researches (creates START_HERE)
- AI2 plans (creates guides)
- AI3 executes (builds deliverable)
- Mode 5: Capture learnings (Friday)

**Week 2-3: Second Substep**
- Faster (applied learnings from first)
- Mode 1: Auto-resume daily
- Mode 5: Capture learnings weekly

**Month 1: 2-3 Substeps Complete**
- Mode 7: Health check (validate framework usage)
- Patterns emerging
- Velocity improving

**Quarter 1: 6-10 Substeps Complete**
- Mode 2: Refine strategy (update Steps)
- Mode 8: Evolve templates (apply learnings)
- Systematic execution established

---

## Minimum Viable Configuration

**Bare minimum to start:**
- [x] ATLAS3 framework installed (40 files)
- [ ] Vision doc (YOUR_COMPANY_CONTEXT.md, 200+ lines)
- [ ] Strategy files (ATLAS_STEPS_TRACKER.md + steps/STEP_1.md, STEP_2.md)

**Can refine later:**
- Vision doc (expand from 200 to 600 lines)
- Steps (add STEP_3.md, STEP_4.md, detail STEP_1 further)
- Assumptions (fill in ATLAS_ASSUMPTIONS.md)
- Brand (create BRAND.md)

**Don't wait for perfect. Start with good enough.**

---

## Daily Usage

**Morning:**
```
"Run ATLAS Mode 1"
Usher: Finds active work (or suggests next)
You: Continue for 2-4 hours (AI executes, you review)
```

**Friday:**
```
"Run ATLAS Mode 5"
Usher: Extracts learnings from completed Effort
You: Review/approve (15 minutes)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: "ATLAS says required files missing"**
→ Run Mode 7 (Health Check) - diagnose what's missing

**Problem: "Don't understand three-phase workflow"**
→ Read ATLAS_SPECIFICATION.md (technical details)
→ Run Mode 4 (Overview/AMA) - ask questions

**Problem: "Substep is too vague"**
→ Run Mode 2 (Refine Substeps) - make specific before AI1

**Problem: "Work feels heavy/slow"**
→ Run Mode 7 (Health Check) - check workflow compliance
→ Run Mode 8 (after 10 Efforts) - evolve templates

---

## Success Metrics

**After 2 hours:** Operational (can execute)
**After 1 week:** First substep complete
**After 1 month:** 2-3 substeps complete, patterns emerging
**After 3 months:** 6-10 substeps, noticeable efficiency gains
**After 6 months:** Initial strategic milestones achieved, framework matured

**Start in 2 hours. Refine as you go. Build systematically.** ⚡
